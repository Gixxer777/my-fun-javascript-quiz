# My Fun Javascript Quiz

## Description

This website was built to showcase my work on skills in Javascript and also as a test of knowledge about Javascript. I learned to use the DOM to save high scores in this project and continued using Javascript to apply it to a real world situation. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the website, click on the Start Quiz button and that will start your Timer and the multiple choice quiz. For correct answers the timer will continue its countdown at a normal pace, but for incorrect answers you will get a 10 second timer deduction. When all the questions are answered, the time left will be your score and you can save your initials for your score which is stored in localStorage.
